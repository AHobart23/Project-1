# Project-2

This project was to show investors how much more money they can save with putting away money early and regularly as opposed to saving in just one lump sum.
I think the display and format of this was done very well.
The code could be made more secure, unfortunately I am not sure how to go about doing that.
I found implementing the formula to calculate interest and formatting to be the most difficult.
Learning how to make loops, functions and making readable code with be easily transferable to other projects.
